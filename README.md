Features:
* Users login in and signing up to create new users and play the game
* Betting system with different buttons
* Spinning visuals
* Background music
* others

Potential Problems:
* the system was not run on different machines so I am not sure if mysql connection will work but it will be worked on

Future work:
* Adding spinning sound that is saved in the files for now but i couldn't get it to work
* Adding more security to the project, like mysql connection
* adding personalized Users input like profile picture
* use Docker so it runs on different machines
* Change visuals of the project
* Change mysql connections so it works even if mysql is not present in the system
* Guest button if above future work can't be implemented 

Bugs:
* Not found yet except for some crashes with no explanation in early stages of the game but didn't happen after
